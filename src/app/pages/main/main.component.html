    <h2>Global Population growth and Its Effect on The Environment</h2>
    <p>Global population growth has a significant impact on the environment. As the world's population grows, the demand
      for resources and energy also increases, leading to a range of environmental challenges. Here are some key ways in
      which population growth affects the environment:</p>

    <h3>Climate Change</h3>
    <p>The increasing number of people on the planet contributes to climate change, mainly through greenhouse gas
      emissions from transportation, agriculture, and energy production. As the world's population continues to grow, so
      will the demand for energy and resources, leading to more emissions and more rapid climate change.</p>

    <h3>Deforestation</h3>
    <p>With the growing population, more land is needed for agriculture, housing, and industry. This leads to
      deforestation, which has a significant impact on the environment, including loss of biodiversity and carbon
      storage.</p>

    <h3>Water Scarcity:</h3>
    <p>As the population grows, so does the demand for water. This can lead to water scarcity in some regions,
      particularly in areas with low rainfall or limited water resources.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card my-5 mx-5 silver-border shadow p-3">
    <h3>Pollution</h3>
    <p>As more people consume resources and generate waste, pollution levels can increase, leading to air and water
      pollution, soil contamination, and other environmental problems.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card my-5 mx-5 silver-border shadow p-3">
    <h3>Loss of Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>With the increasing demand for land, water, and other resources, ecosystems and habitats are being destroyed,
      leading to the loss of biodiversity and extinction of many species.</p>
    <p>Global population growth refers to the increase in the number of people living in the world over time. The world
      population has been steadily increasing over the past few decades, and is currently estimated to be around 7.9
      billion people. Here are some key statistics related to global population growth:</p>

    <p>The world population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and could potentially reach 11 billion by 2100.
      The population growth rate has been slowing down over time, but the absolute number of people added to the world's
      population each year is still quite high.
      Population growth is not evenly distributed across the world. Some regions, such as Africa and Asia, are
      experiencing rapid population growth, while other regions, such as Europe and North America, have relatively
      stable or even declining populations.</p>

    <h3>Pros of global population growth-</h3>
    <h3>Economic growth</h3>
    <p>Population growth can lead to increased economic growth, as more people means a larger workforce and more
      consumers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card my-5 mx-5 silver-border shadow p-3">
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>A larger population can lead to more innovation, as there are more people with different backgrounds and
      perspectives.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card my-5 mx-5 silver-border shadow p-3">
    <h3>Cultural diversity</h3>
    <p>A larger population can also lead to increased cultural diversity, as there are more people from different
      regions and backgrounds.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card my-5 mx-5 silver-border shadow p-3">
    <h3>Cons of global population growth:</h3>

    <h3>Environmental impact</h3>
    <p>A larger population can have a negative impact on the environment, as more people means more demand for resources
      and more pollution.</p>
    Resource depletion: A larger population can also lead to resource depletion, as there are more people using
    resources such as water, land, and food.
    Social issues: A larger population can lead to social issues such as overcrowding, poverty, and inequality, as
    resources become more scarce and competition for them increases.
